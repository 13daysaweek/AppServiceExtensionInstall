# Installing Specific versions of App Service Site Extensions

## Overview
Azure App Serivce makes it possible to install site extensions, manually, via the extension gallery, or through ARM templates.  Extensions are sourced from the public nuget.org feed.  Whether installing manually from the gallery or via ARM templates, there isn't a way to explicitly specify the version of the site extension you wish to install, the most recent version will always be installed.
